# Dart Tic-Tac-Toe Console Application


A simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in Dart. This project allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. The application provides an interactive and user-friendly experience for players.


## Features

- Game Board: A 3x3 grid represents the Tic-Tac-Toe board, displaying the current state after each move.

- Players: Two players take turns, one representing 'X' and the other 'O.' Players input their moves through the console.

- Input Validation: User inputs are validated to ensure they are within the valid range (1-9) and correspond to an empty cell on the board. An error message is displayed for invalid inputs, prompting the player to enter a valid move.

- Winning Conditions: The game checks for winning conditions after each move and declares the winner if there are three consecutive 'X' or 'O' markers in a row, column, or diagonal.

- Draw Condition: The game declares a draw if all cells are filled, and no player has achieved a winning condition.

- Game Loop: A loop allows the game to continue until there is a winner or a draw. Players have the option to restart the game after it concludes.

- Code Structure: The code is organized into functions and classes to enhance readability and maintainability, following proper naming conventions.

- Documentation: Comments and documentation within the code explain the logic and functionality, making it easy for others to understand and contribute.

- Bonus Feature
AI Opponent: A bonus feature includes the implementation of a simple AI opponent for players who want to play against the computer.

Player Marker Choice: Players can choose their markers ('X' or 'O') at the beginning of the game.
